node-extjs-express (ALPHA)
==========================

An extension to [node-extjs](https://github.com/storminwalker/node-extjs) to support the [ExpressJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) Node web framework.

This is a work in progress and perhaps a work of insanity as well!

Installation
------------

	npm install node-extjs-express

This will load all the necessary dependencies.

Usage
-----

Check the examples for full usage. Will update this more over time.

	require("node-extjs-express");

	console.log(Ext.getVersion().version);
